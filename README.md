# Reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement Learning Course from IPVS

This repository collects the code developed during the course of reinforcement learning at the University of Stuttgart.
The Main Algorithms are implemented in python such as
- Monte-Carlo Learning
- Temporal-Difference Learning
- TD(lambda)
- Q-learning
- Function Approximation approximations towards a continuous state space
- Policy Gradient Method
- Inverse reinforcement learning
